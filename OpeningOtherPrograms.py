#This is python code for opening other programs\applications using python
#First you had to import "os"nmodule
import os
#This module is in-built in python 3

#Now just write "os.startfile("proper address of program as string")"

#os.startfile("C://Windows//system32//mspaint.exe")
os.startfile(r"C:\Windows\system32\mspaint.exe")
#These are two ways to give address

#And when you run/compile it "paint will open"

#You can open any program/application using it
